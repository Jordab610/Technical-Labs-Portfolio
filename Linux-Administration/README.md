# Live Portfolio: System Automation & Professional Growth
This repository serves as a dynamic record of my technical development. 

## 🎯 Professional Development Goals
My current focus is on mastering the **CompTIA A+** objectives while building a practical toolkit for modern enterprise environments.
- **Goal 1:** Automate 100% of my routine workstation maintenance tasks.
- **Goal 2:** Deepen proficiency in Zsh/Bash scripting for macOS and Linux.
- **Goal 3:** Implement Version Control (Git) as a standard for all technical documentation.

## 🛠️ Active Projects (Work in Progress)

### 🖥️ Workstation Health Monitor (`check_system.sh`)
*Status: Functional / Optimization Phase*
- **Purpose:** Identifies system bottlenecks (RAM/Disk) and parses logs to catch errors before they cause downtime.
- **Development Key:** Learning to use `grep` and `tail` to transform raw log data into actionable alerts.

### 🧹 Maintenance Automation (`cleanup_logs.sh`)
*Status: Functional*
- **Purpose:** Implements the "Clean Desk" policy for file systems by targeting stale temporary data.
- **Development Key:** Mastering `find` with `-mtime` logic and ensuring accountability through automated logging.

## 🍎 Platform Focus: Apple Silicon
As I work in an M1-driven environment at Astreya, these tools are developed to handle the specific security and architecture nuances of Apple Silicon.

### Operational Setup
1. **Bootstrap Environment:** Run `./install.sh` to configure permissions and verify dependencies.
2. **Scheduling:** Currently utilizing `crontab` for automated weekday execution.
