# Technical Labs & Systems Engineering Portfolio

## 🚀 Professional Philosophy
I approach systems administration with a **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** mindset. My goal is to build infrastructure that is not only functional but also documented, automated, and resilient. I focus on reducing "toil" through scripting and maintaining high observability standards.

## 📚 Learning & Upskilling
I keep a structured approach to growing as a coder and future SRE—including how I **review and improve AI-generated code**, **test for reliability**, and **build infrastructure skills**. This is documented so I stay intentional and so recruiters can see active upskilling.

* **[Learning Path: From IT Support to SRE](./Documentation/Learning_Path_SRE_Upskilling.md)** — Why I'm learning, how I improve code, how I test, and what infrastructure concepts I'm building.
* **[Code Review Checklist](./Documentation/Code_Review_Checklist.md)** — Used when reviewing my own or AI-produced code before calling it "done."
* **[Testing Checklist](./Documentation/Testing_Checklist.md)** — Used before "shipping" to reduce risk of downtime and unclear failures.

## 📅 Contact & Growth
