# Technical Labs & Systems Engineering Portfolio

## 🚀 Professional Philosophy
I approach systems administration with a **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** mindset. My goal is to build infrastructure that is not only functional but also documented, automated, and resilient. I focus on reducing "toil" through scripting and maintaining high observability standards.
