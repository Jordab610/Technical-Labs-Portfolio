# Technical Portfolio: Hybrid Systems Admin & SRE Mindset

This repository is a live documentation of my professional development, bridging the gap between System Administration and Site Reliability Engineering. My goal is to apply software engineering principles to improve infrastructure reliability, scalability, and efficiency.

## 🎯 Development Goals
* **Automate for Reliability:** Utilizing Python to automate repetitive manual tasks, reducing human error.
* **Resilient Tooling:** Implementing SRE-level standards (try/except blocks, input normalization) to build robust, crash-proof tools.
* **Infrastructure Management:** Efficiently querying and managing hardware assets using advanced data structures.

## 📈 Technical Evolution (Project Logs)

### Phase 1: Foundational Logic & Data Structures
*Focus: Mapping infrastructure data and handling user-driven queries efficiently.*
* **SRE-Mindset Asset Finder (`sre_asset_finder.py`)** - *Feb 9, 2026*
    * Designed for resilient asset lookups; uses `try/except` for error handling and `.strip().lower()` for input normalization.
* **Master Health Monitor (`master_check.py`)** - *Feb 6, 2026*
    * Implemented Dictionary mapping for $O(1)$ efficiency in status lookups.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
* **Languages:** Python
* **Infrastructure:** Linux/Windows Systems Administration, Network Troubleshooting.
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub.
