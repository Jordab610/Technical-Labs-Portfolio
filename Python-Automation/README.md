# Systems & Automation Lab 🛠️

A professional repository dedicated to mastering IT automation, system administration, and technical problem-solving. This lab documents my journey of mapping programming logic to real-world infrastructure management.

## 🎯 Project Goals
* **Efficiency:** Automating repetitive manual tasks to save time and reduce human error.
* **Reliability:** Building resilient scripts with robust error handling for production environments.
* **Technical Growth:** Bridging the gap between hardware knowledge (CompTIA A+) and software automation.

## 📂 Learning Phases
* **Phase 1: Logic & Foundations** (Current)
    * Data structures, user input, and error handling.
* **Phase 2: System Operations** (Upcoming)
    * Interacting with the OS, file systems, and network diagnostic tools.
* **Phase 3: Integration & APIs** (Upcoming)
    * Connecting tools to external services and cloud platforms.

## 🚀 Key Achievements
* **Interactive Asset Finder**: A tool for querying hardware databases with built-in error handling.
* **Multi-Point Health Monitor**: A script that maps network identities to real-time status reports.
